Lexer and Parser from Simple Arithmetic Language

To build, run make.

To run after building, run ./run.native.
The program takes in (repeatedly) an arithmetic expression followed by a newline and produces on separate lines:
    - the tokens produced by the lexer
    - the AST produced by the parser
